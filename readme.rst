###################
Our inspiration is from another application like SmartCity which is that application has been work in any city on Indonesia. 
Isun Banyuwangi will give information about Banyuwangi tourism, art events, crafts, culinary, arts and culture. 
Isun Banyuwangi will be provide geographic information in a map to make it easier for tourists to reach the destination.

*******************
What it does
*******************

Isun Banyuwangi can give any information about Banyuwangi like tourism , art events, craft, arts and culture. 
Isun Banyuwangi can give a geographic information in a map to make it easier for tourist to reach the destination. 
Isun Banyuwangi can help UMKM in Banyuwangi active to compete the 4.0 industry revolution with promote and manage the product and increase sales effectively

**************************
How I built it
**************************

We built the application using the PHP programming language using the Code Igniter Framework and using the MySQL database as a data storage media. 
The data that we need for this application is the location (latitude and longitude) of tourism or UMKM as well as a description of the place, 
to be displayed on the website and using google maps technology as a medium to show and provide directions for the tour, by taking the last location user (latitude and longitude).

*******************
Challenges I ran into
*******************
- There is a need for activeness from UMKM to keep updating the product so that the content is always fresh and interesting
- The biggest challenge we faced is when determining the closest tourist location with the best rating. Some locations that offer local products are also a challenge because we have to contact owners of local product in the form of snacks, heavy meals and drinks. This is a very interesting challenge because by highlighting features like this, the tourists who come to Banyuwangi can find out their destination without having to be confused looking for a place to sell typical Banyuwangi food or natural attractions that only exist in Banyuwangi.

************
What I learned
************

1. Learn the literature needed to make the application
2. Learn the culture of Banyuwangi so that the information provided by <b>Isun Banyuwangi<b> is accurate and real
